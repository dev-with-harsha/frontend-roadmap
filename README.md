# Introduction

<p>Front-end development involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a client-side application. The client-side of an online application is the visual part of a web application and also what a user interacts with when an application is opened: colours, fonts, buttons, navigations, animations, etc.</p>

<p>Front-end development includes the user interface of an application. Everything a user interacts with when a user visits a website such as a login or sign-up page, homepage, contact page falls under the front-end development term.</p>

<p>A front-end developer is responsible for building and implementing the interface of a website or web application. They build client-side applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>In 2021 however, front-end development has gone beyond HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are a lot of web technologies you need to learn to be able to excel as a front-end developer this year.</p>

<p>This article will cover all you need to get started with front-end development in 2021.</p>

# 1. Basic Terminal Usage ( Command Line or CLI)

<p>The terminal is an interface used to execute text commands, and it gives you access to the underlying operating system. Basic terminal usage is a skill all developers need regardless of their specialization. Command line is very important so I strongly recommend you study more on how to use it. The better you are with the command line, the more efficient you will be as a front-end developer.</p>

# 2. Version Control

<p>Git is a version control system that enables developers to track changes in their project. Git also helps developers collaborate as a team. Git is needed among developers, to ensure that there are no code conflicts between developers.</p>

# 3. GitHub

<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for software development. GitHub lets teams work together on projects and it is also used for version control. It can be used among teams to collaborate on a project. For example, a team of developers wants to build a web application and everyone is given a task that has to be updated daily while working on the project, in this case, Github helps them build a centralized repository where each team member can make updates or manage the code file or repository.</p>

# 4. Text Editor / IDE (Integrated development environment)

<p>The text editor is where you will write your code. Having the right text editor can improve your productivity.</p>
<p>There are a lot of IDE to pick from, but letâ€™s look at a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"> Visual Studio Code</a> - <code>Recommended</code> visual studio code is the best IDE for front-end development. It works across all operating systems such as macOS, Windows, and Linux. Visual studio code comes with a great deal of extension which helps in improving productivity as a front-end developer.</li>
  
  <li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> - Atom is an open-source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Windows developed by Github with supports for plugins.</li>
</ul>

# 5. Web Fundamentals

<em><b>It is important to understand how the web works before you start learning any technologies. You should learn about things like:</b></em>
